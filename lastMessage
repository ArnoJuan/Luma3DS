Got rid of CakeHax, patched CakeBrah to load arm9loaderhax.bin directly (lifting size restrictions in the process), got rid of the pathchanger (to have a custom path you can now enable the option and write it in a /luma/path.txt file, it must start with a / (this path is also picked up by the patched CakeBrah loader), fixed loading SafeA9LHInstaller and other payloads which need the OTP hash if having a PIN, fixed writing a file smaller than the existing one not removing the extra size, slightly changed the PIN format, added support for the alternate framebuffer and made the splash screen use it (it is now displayed all at once), fixed screen issues from CakeBrah
